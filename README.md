# Code from the Polymath REU Walking to Infinity on Special Sequences project

The code is organized by language so that people who knew different programming
languages would still be able to test out sequences, since the tree system I
came up with for checking every possible path of a sequence is so versatile.
Each language has an implementation of the tree system as well as a sample and a
template, so you can easily try out any sequence you want. Rust was primarily
used for the hefty calculations involving things other than the tree system,
since it is so fast and easy to use. All the tree code is well documented and
commented, and the fast code is not, but fairly straightforward.
